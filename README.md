# Wealth-AgentBasedModel
The objective of this mini project is to create an agent-based model that simulates the distribution of wealth among a population of agents. Through various interactions and transactions, this model aims to explore how wealth inequality evolves over time and what factors contribute to the distribution of wealth.


## Description:
In this agent-based model simulation, we delve into the dynamics of wealth accumulation and distribution within a community of agents. Each agent represents an individual or entity, and they interact with one another through a set of rules and transactions.

## Key Components and Features:

Agents: The simulation will feature a population of agents, each characterized by initial wealth levels and behaviors. These agents will engage in interactions with their peers, which may include economic transactions.

Wealth Dynamics: Agents will accumulate, spend, and transfer wealth over time based on predefined rules. Wealth may be gained through the money the have, and it may be lost due to transactions. There are diffent models in the code such that every model has different rule (win-loose, win-win-loose). 

Interactions: The model will define a set of interactions between agents. The outcome of these interactions will influence the wealth of participating agents. There is specific probability to win at each transaction.

Wealth Inequality Metrics: To evaluate the distribution of wealth, the simulation will calculate and visualize wealth inequality metrics over time. 

## Expected Outcomes:
Wealth Distribution Patterns: The simulation will generate insights into the wealth distribution patterns, such as the 
poor precentage, maximum wealth and the precentage of the wealth.

Impact of Interactions: By studying the consequences of various agent interactions, the mini project aims to identify which types of interactions contribute most significantly to wealth inequality or economic well-being.
