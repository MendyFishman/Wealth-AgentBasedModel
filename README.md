# Wealth-AgentBasedModel
The objective of this mini project is to create an agent-based model that simulates the distribution of wealth among a population of agents. Through various interactions and transactions, this model aims to explore how wealth inequality evolves over time and what factors contribute to the distribution of wealth.
